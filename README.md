# mnist-classifier
Basic implementation of MNIST classifier following the the [Neural Networks and Deep Learning book](https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) Chapters 1 through 3. Run `test.py` and comment or un-comment the relevant code to activate various features.

This is essentially another 'by hand' implementation. To use a framework like Tensorflow to do the same, check out the [Tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers).
